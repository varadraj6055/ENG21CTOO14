# Welcome to Create React App

This project was made using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to Run

In your project folder, use these commands:

- `npm start`: Opens the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will reload as you make changes.
- `npm test`: Runs tests in watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production in the `build` folder. The build is optimized for better performance.
- `npm run eject`: This command lets you customize the build configuration, but it's a one-way operation.
